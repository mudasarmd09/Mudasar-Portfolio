I want you to carefully review and edit my entire portfolio content to ensure that:

There are no contradictions or repeated/conflicting claims.

For example, if one place says I’ve delivered 2 projects and another says 3, make sure they are consistent.

All statements are presented in a clear, professional, and unified way so that the reader feels confident the information is genuine.

The content flows logically and feels coherent—like one credible story, not scattered pieces.

Do NOT change or redesign the layout, personal information, or tone of voice—only fix inconsistencies and repetitions.

If any claims cannot be verified from the reference data below, simplify or remove them to avoid exaggeration.
