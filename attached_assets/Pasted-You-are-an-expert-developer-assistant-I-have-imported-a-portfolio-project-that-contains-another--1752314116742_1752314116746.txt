- **About Section:**
  "Problem Solver by Nature | Full Stack Developer by Practice | Tech Collaborator by Choice. Over the past years, I’ve worked closely with designers, developers, and AI experts to turn early-stage ideas into real products — whether that meant building modern Web3 dashboards, mobile-first platforms, or integrating OpenAI into smart business tools. My primary stack revolves around React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, and I’ve been diving deeper into blockchain technologies like Solidity, Web3.js, and NFT smart contracts. When needed, I integrate AI tools (Python, OpenAI APIs) to help apps think smarter and serve better. What drives me is solving real-world problems with code — from intuitive UI/UX designs to backend logic that scales. Every project I take on is an opportunity to explore, refine, and deliver."
